Certainly, Michael. Here’s a **detailed requirements list** for a modern chat application capable of sending/receiving text, images, and video, with secure authentication, search, and QR code-based connection features.

### **E. Security & Privacy**

* **End-to-End Encryption**

  * Encrypt all messages and media (both in transit and at rest).
* **Secure Media Handling**

## **2. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **A. Performance**

* Low latency messaging (messages delivered within 1 second).
* Media uploads/downloads optimized for bandwidth.

### **B. Scalability**

* Handle thousands of concurrent users and group chats.
* Support for horizontal scaling (microservices, load balancing).

### **C. Reliability**

* High availability (99.9% uptime).
* Message delivery guarantee (retry logic, message queue).

### **D. Security**

* Use secure authentication protocols (OAuth2, JWT).
* All data transmitted over HTTPS/TLS 1.2+.
* Regular penetration testing and security audits.
* Compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA if needed).

### **E. Usability**

* Simple, intuitive UI/UX.
* Accessibility features (screen reader support, high contrast mode).

## **3. System Integration & Extensibility**

* **API Integration**

  * RESTful APIs for external integration (bots, plugins, export tools).
* **Third-Party Cloud Storage**

  * Option to offload media storage to AWS S3, Azure Blob, etc.
* **Audit Logging**

  * Secure logs of login events, message deletions/edits.

## **4. Administrative & Analytics**

* **Admin Console**

  * Manage/report abusive content or users.
  * System health dashboard.
* **Analytics**

* **Voice Notes / Audio Messages**
* **Location Sharing**
* **Scheduled Messages**
* **Integration with Calendar (for group events)**
* **AI-powered Spam & Abuse Detection**

---

## **Reflective Questions (For Strategic Decision-Making):**

1. **How critical is end-to-end encryption vs. platform-wide moderation/controls?**
2. **What level of media retention is required—should the platform retain, auto-delete, or give full control to users?**
3. **Is the initial focus on speed-to-market or maximum feature completeness?**
4. **What regulatory/privacy considerations are relevant for your target audience or jurisdictions?**
5. **What partnerships or integrations could extend the app’s value (e.g., payment, calendaring, document sharing)?**
