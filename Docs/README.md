    - `agent/vs-2022`
5. Using the pre-created issues, start implementing the features in the respective branches using GitHub Copilot in Agent Mode.
    - For VS Code, use the `agant/vs-code` branch.
    - For Visual Studio 2022, use the `agent/vs-2022` branch.
    - Create the issues in GitHub and assign the issue to GitHub Copilot to complete the implementation.
